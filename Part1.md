# Part I: Exploring Open Data

## 1.1 Introduction

As a freshman new to data science, open data is an exciting concept. Open data allows me to gain a clearer understanding of how society operates. Through data analysis, we can visually perceive the changes in data. Open data means that data is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and share. This idea has become quite popular because it’s believed to improve transparency, spark innovation, and help with making decisions based on data. However, there are also some challenges and downsides to open data. In this report, I’ll look at the pros and cons of open data, suggest some policies for the government, and talk about the challenges data scientists and data engineers might face.

## 1.3 Disadvantages of Open Data

### Privacy Concerns
One of the biggest issues with open data is privacy. Sometimes data that seems harmless can be combined with other data to reveal personal information. This can lead to privacy violations, especially when different datasets are linked together ([Young et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1145/3287560.3287577)).

### Misuse and Misinterpretation of Data
Open data can be misused or misunderstood, leading to wrong conclusions and decisions. Without proper context, data can be misleading, which can result in harmful consequences. For instance, poor data analysis might lead to bad policy decisions that negatively impact communities ([Chauvette, Schick-Makaroff, & Molzahn, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1177/1609406918823863)).

### Legal and Ethical Issues
There are also legal and ethical issues with open data, like intellectual property rights and consent. Not all data can be shared without violating rights or legal agreements. This is a big issue when sharing qualitative research data ([Amann et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw1280)).

### Cost and Resource Allocation
Implementing open data policies can be expensive and requires a lot of resources. Governments need to invest in technology and people to collect, store, and share data.
