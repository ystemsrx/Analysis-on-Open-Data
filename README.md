## Abstract

This report analyzes open data policies highlighting benefits like transparency, economic growth, improved services, and research advancements, as well as challenges such as privacy concerns, data misuse, legal issues, and resource demands. It recommends privacy guidelines, public engagement, data infrastructure investment, legal frameworks, interagency collaboration, and decision-making tools.

Hands-on analyses of transportation finance and electric vehicle datasets illustrate data science techniques. An in-depth examination of a network traffic dataset using regression models with Random Forest outperforming Linear Regression is included.

The report concludes by emphasizing the importance of addressing data privacy, big data management, interdisciplinary collaboration, technological advancements, ethical considerations, and legal constraints for future data scientists and engineers. Continuous learning is crucial in this evolving field.

## Navigation

### Part 1: Exploring Open Data
The first part of the report discusses the concept of open data, its advantages, disadvantages, and suggestions for government policies. It also addresses the challenges that future data scientists and engineers might face. For detailed reading, refer to [Part1.md](Part1.md).

### Part 2: Hands-On with Public Data Sets
This section provides an analysis of two public datasets: Transportation Public Financial Statistics and Electric Vehicle Population Data. It includes exploratory data analysis and insights derived from the datasets. For more details, refer to [Part2.md](Part2.md).

### Part 3: In-Depth Analysis of Network Traffic Data
The third part presents an in-depth analysis of a network traffic dataset using regression models to predict network flow durations. The analysis compares the performance of Linear Regression and Random Forest models. For the full analysis, see [Part3.md](Part3.md).

## Source Code

All the source codes used in the analyses are stored in the [Source Code](Source Code) folder. The folder contains the following scripts:
- **Code of TPFS.r**: Script for analyzing the Transportation Public Financial Statistics dataset.
- **Code of EVPD.r**: Script for analyzing the Electric Vehicle Population Data dataset.
- **Code of DN.r**: Script for the in-depth analysis of the Network Traffic dataset.

These scripts correspond to the datasets used in the respective parts of the report. Each script is well-documented to assist users in understanding and replicating the analyses.

For an aggregated view of all source codes used in this report, refer to [Source Code.md](Source%20Code.md).

## Datasets

The datasets used in this report are provided in a compressed format to reduce file size. The data can be found in the [Datasets](Datasets) folder as a zip file containing all three datasets in CSV format. The zip file needs to be extracted before use.

### Contents:
